# dotfiles

Customized version of [jasonrudolph/keyboard](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard) that I use on all of my computers. I may add additional dot/config type files over time, these are published to support an article on [my site](https://josephmclaughl.in/posts/hammerspoon/).

`local.hidutilKeyMapping.plist` remaps the Caps Lock key on the internal keyboard to the fn key. It should be placed in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`. More information about using hidutil to remap keys can be found in [this great article](https://rakhesh.com/mac/using-hidutil-to-map-macos-keyboard-keys/) by [@rakheshster](https://github.com/rakheshster).
